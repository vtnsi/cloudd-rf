# Welcome to the CLOUD-D RF Codebase!

This branch is is specifically designed to make use of an Amazon SageMaker Pipeline to handle the end-to-end workflow from data generation and model training to output visualization.

ðŸš§ Note - this branch is set up with an older version of our codebase. Development work is currently in progress to update this branch to make use of the newer version.

To run this code in Amazon Sagemaker, follow the below steps.

1. Clone this repository to Amazon SageMaker.
2. Run the `sagemaker-pipelines-project.ipynb` script. This will initialize and run an Amazon SageMaker Pipeline.
